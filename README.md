# EduDataBot Prototype Application

This  application demonstrates an implementation of [EduDataBot]([https://github.com/roy-saurabh/un-vision-ai]) using Streamlit front end library.

EduDataBot leverages open-source python libraries for generating data visualizations and data-faithful infographics. It is grammar agnostic (will work with any programming language and visualization libraries e.g. matplotlib, seaborn, altair, d3 etc) and works with multiple large language model providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, PaLM, Cohere, Huggingface). 

See the project page [here](https://github.com/roy-saurabh/un-vision-ai) for updates.

EduDataBot transforms complex data sets into clear, compelling visualizations and infographics. Powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and integrated seamlessly with Azure OpenAI services, EduDataBot is designed to elevate your data presentation game. This guide aims to walk you through the process of leveraging EduDataBot's capabilities to extract meaningful insights from data, supported by a robust theoretical framework.

# Getting Started 

Your journey begins with EduDataBot's ability to interface with leading Python libraries, such as LlamaIndex, Lida, Trulens, and AffectLog, accommodating a wide range of programming languages and visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly). This ensures that regardless of your preferred tools or languages, EduDataBot is equipped to serve your needs.

# Data Analysis and Goal Generation

At the heart of EduDataBot's process lies the utilization of UIS data, processed through the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique for accuracy and relevance. Before moving to the visualization stage, goals are refined using Trulens and AffectLog, ensuring they are trustworthy and meaningful. This step is crucial for setting a solid foundation for the visual representations that follow.

# Custom Visualization Creation

EduDataBot not only suggests goals based on the processed data but also empowers you to select from these to tailor your analysis further. Choose your visualization library and let EduDataBot guide you through generating custom plots that highlight your data's key aspects.

# Python Code for Visualization 

A unique feature of EduDataBot is its provision of Python code snippets, allowing you to recreate or customize visualizations independently. This aspect encourages deeper engagement with your data, offering the flexibility to tweak and adjust your visualizations as needed.

# Instructional Guide

1.	Define Your Objectives: Begin by setting clear objectives for what you wish to achieve with your data analysis.
2.	Select Generated Goals: Browse through EduDataBot's suggested goals based on your data set and select the ones that align with your objectives.
3.	Choose a Visualization Library: Pick from popular libraries such as Seaborn or Matplotlib, depending on your preference and the nature of your data.
4.	Generate and Customize Visualizations: Use EduDataBot's generated Python code to create visualizations. Feel free to adjust the code to suit your specific analysis needs.

# Exploring Further

EduDataBot is built on a foundation of trustworthiness and reliability, thanks to its sophisticated backend processes. By engaging with the tool, you not only gain access to high-quality visualizations but also contribute to a broader understanding of data's narrative potential.

Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or just beginning to explore the world of data visualization, EduDataBot offers a comprehensive platform to enhance your analytical capabilities.‚Äù
